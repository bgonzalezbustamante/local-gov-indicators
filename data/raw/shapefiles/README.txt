The file "COMUNAS_2020.shp" is over 100MB, therefore, it is available on the OSF project repository to avoid using Git LFS. 

The repository also contains a zipped file with different shapefiles considering county and regional levels. 

Both files have been added to the .gitignore file on this GitHub repository.
